 Problem Statement
 * You have three sticks. Their current lengths are a, b, and c. You can shorten each of those sticks arbitrarily. Your goal is to produce three sticks with the following properties:
 * The length of each stick is a positive integer.
 * The three sticks can be used to build a triangle. The triangle must be non-degenerate. (I.e., it must have a positive area.)
 * The perimeter of the triangle must be as large as possible.
 * You are given the ints a, b, and c. Compute and return the largest possible perimeter of the triangle constructed from your three sticks.

 Definition
 Class:	TriangleMaking
 Method:	maxPerimeter
 Parameters:	int, int, int
 Returns:	int
 Method signature:	int maxPerimeter(int a, int b, int c)
 (be sure your method is public)


 Notes
 -	The return value is always defined. In other words, for any a, b, and c there is at least one way to build a valid triangle.
